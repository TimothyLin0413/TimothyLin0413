# üí´ About Me:
My name is Tzu-Yu Lin also go by Timothy Lin and I'm currently an undergraduate studying computer science at the University of California-Irvine.

I'm currently working on a full-stack web application using Java and Dynamic HTML.<br>I'm looking to collaborate on any topics or projects that involve Project Management, Software Development, and Software Engineering. <br>I'm looking for help with learning new programming languages and management tools. <br>I'm currently learning JavaScript and Agile Methodologies. <br>I want to be a software project manager in the future!<br>Fun Fact: I love playing and watching sports, notably baseball, basketball and badminton (3Bs).<br>                 I believe technology will be more involved within the sports field either on the court or off the court in the future. 

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my socials to talk about anything, to collaborate on a project, or to start something wonderful!
